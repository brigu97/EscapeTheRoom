My name is Vishwas Basotra, i am a student and i like designing. This is my first game in Unreal Engine.

Concept:

*The core concept is simple:- Escape the building.
*You are stuck in a locked room, unable to escape.
*Use environment clues such as light and sound to determine what to do next.
*Trigger pressure plates and solve puzzles to pregress towards the exit.

Rules:

*No lose condition, apart from the feeling you're going to die in the room if you don't get out!
*Anything that you can do, you are allowed to do.
*You win by finally exiting the building.

Requirement:

*Unreal Engine 4.19.2.
*Unreal's provided starter content pack.
*C++ code and blueprint to encode behaviour.
*Microsoft Visual Studio.
