My name is Vishwas Basotra. I am a student and I like designing. This is my first game in Unreal Engine.


Concept:-


You are stuck in a locked room, unable to escape. Use environment clues such as light and sound to determine what to do next. Trigger pressure plates and solve puzzles to progress towards the exit.


Rules:-


1: No lose condition, apart from the feeling you're going to die in the room if you don't get out!

2: Anything that you can do, you are allowed to do.

3: You win by finally exiting the building.


Requirement:-


1: Unreal Engine 4.19.2.

2: Unreal's provided starter content pack.

3: C++ code and blueprint to encode behaviour.

4: Microsoft Visual Studio.
